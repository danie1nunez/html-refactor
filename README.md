# html-refactor

~SUMMARY~
In this website I was able to refactor all of the semantic elements that were not correctly describing the
code they were containing. I was also able to make sure they were in a logical order and structure. In, addition
I viewed the Icon and image elements and added alt tags as needed. Also, I changed to title to better reflect the 
purpose of the website, while keeping it concise. Lastly, I refactored the css code to avoid any unnecessary 
duplications in code, making sure I did not change the structure of the website.

** I hope this work is up to the standards expected of me :) **
